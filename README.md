  Integral Database App Jake Hernandez 08/19/2020
  This app will allow a user to input an integral
  or look up integrals by index to give back 
  documented solution to it. This app also gives 
  the user the option to summon the inbuilt
  calculator for a numerical answer to a specific
  integral once the user inputs a lower and upper
  value.
